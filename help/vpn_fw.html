<header>VPN on Firewall</header>

If the VPN gateway is a firewall, you can select <b>Yes</b> to automaticly insert
firewall rules to open for VPN Security Assoriation ( SA ) establishment to
and from the firewall.
<p>
If you select <b>No</b> you will have to ajust the firewall ruleset yourself.
<p>
Note that only the VPN tunnel (SA) and connection negotiation will be opened
for. You will still have to
create rules to define the policy for members in the VPN. Remote objects are
now connected over the virtual IPSEC interface ( default ipsec0 ) and not
the real interface ( eth?).
<p>
Modify the <b>Location</b> parameter for the object  describing where the object is
connected. Set it to the virtual IPSEC interface ( ipsec? ) corresponding to the
real IF the tunnel is running over.
<p>
Interface definitions are defined in the module configuration view.
