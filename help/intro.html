<header>Introduction to Cumulus Firewall</header>

The Cumulus Firewall module allows to create and modify a shell
script containing  calls for ipchains, the Linux firewall administration
tool. <P>

The script is generated from a set of rules defining accepted and denied
communication services between network objects.
<p>
You define service and network objects as simple objects or as a collection
( group) of simpler objects.

<p>
You will probably start by defining the service and network objects, and
then create the ruleset. The script manager is used to generate the script
and optionally install the policy by executing it.
