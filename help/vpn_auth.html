<header>VPN authentication</header>

The VPN endpoints must authenticate to one another. 
<p>
The autentication can be based on a pre-shared secret or on public/private
key pairs (RSA).
<p>

You can not mix RSA and PSK authentication on the same gateway unless all
identifying local-remote IP address pairs are uniqe.

<h2>RSA public/private keys</h2>
This is the prefered method. Generate a set of keys on each of the
gatewayes. The public part of the  generated key can be inserted as the
<b>Local PUB key</b> for easy access. The actual used keys are stored in the
file <b>my.key</b> in the config area. <p>

Copy the PUBLIC part of the key to all other VPN endpoints that
should be able to connect. The copied keys should always be pasted into the
<b>Remote PUB key</b> field.<p>
For each tunnel you have to obtain the public key for the remote end and
paste it into the Remote PUB key field.

<h2>Pre-shared secrets</h2>
You must enter a common secret on both endpoints. The secret is identified
by the IP adresses of the communicating VPN gateways.<p>
To allow DHCP or other dynamicly assigned addresses you can specify 0.0.0.0
as the address on one side.
