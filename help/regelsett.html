<header>Cumulus Firewall - Editing Rules</header>

This file describes the editing of rules in this module<P>

An ACCEPT rule will generete filter rules to pass the packets in, forward
and output it to the destinaten. The replies to TCP and UDP sessions are
allowed to travel in the opposite direction. <br><b>
Other protocols are unidirectional.</b><p>

First, you surely want to know, what all those columns in the
table are good for, so here you are:<BR><BR>

<U>Nr.</U><BR>
Rule number. Click on this to edit the rule. When you edit the rule you can
save the rule at a different number. The old rule is left unchanged if number is
changed.<br>
This is how you copy and move rules.
<P>
<U>Source</U><BR>
As you may guess, this column represents the source address, a
packet comes from. 

<BR><BR><U>Destination</U><BR>
The destination of a packet. For example you want http to go
through but to block ftp. All those warez servers...

<BR><BR><U>Service</U><BR>
This is the service to process.

<BR><BR><U>F (Fragment)</U><BR>
Matches the secont through the last fragment of a fragmented packet.
Not used at the moment!

<BR><BR><U>L (Logging)</U><BR>
If set (X) session is logged.
<p>
All DENY and REJECT packets may be logged. Only  ACCEPTed TCP sessions will be
logged.( Other protocols are not connection oriented, and may produse to
much log data.)

<BR><BR><U>TOS (Type Of Service)</U><BR>
ipchains can change the TOS of a packet. To do this there are several
possible values. This is shown in this column.
