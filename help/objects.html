<header>Cumulus Firewall - Objects</header>

Objects may be hosts, networks, interfaces and groups of other objects.
<p>
If no objects are defined, a set of objects describing the firewall and the
directly connected networks will be generated automaticly. This process will
depend on the assignement of interfaces to network classes done in the
<b>Module configuration</b>
<p>If no matching network for an interface is found, the network is
classified as EXTn. Configuration will not be complete, and must be revised
after the module configuration is done.
<p>
The <b>Network objects list</b> displays all defined objects with
their key parameters. To edit an object you just click on the apropriate
link in this list. See <A href="objects-edit">Editing an object</a>
<p>
Note that groups are edited/created in a different form than all the other
objects.
