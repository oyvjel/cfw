A simple service is an IP protocol plus apropriate additional parameters
such as port numbers, ICMP types etc.

Services may be a simple service, a service defined in the systems
/etc/services file or a group of other services.

The <b>Services list</b> displays all defined services except for the
services in /etc/services. To edit a service you just click on the apropriate
link in this list. See <A href="service-edit">Editing a service</a>

Note that groups are edited/created in a different form than all the other
services.
