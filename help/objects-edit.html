<header>Cumulus Firewall - Editing Objects</header>

This file describes the editing of a single object<P>
See <A href="group-edit">Groups</a> for editing groups of objects.
<p>

The object name must be unique. To copy an object you just enter the new
name to copy to. The old object is uncganged.
<p>
You must specify a valid IP address for the object. 
<p>
The network mask may be specified as a dotted quad or as the number of bits.
If the network mask is left blank the object is assumed to be a host.
<p>
Check the <b>Interface on FW</b> to define an address on a firewall
interface. 
<p>
<h3>Interfaces with dynamic IP</h3>
As the IP address is not known at the time of firewall configuration the
interface address has to be set to 0.0.0.0. and a blank netmask. Make sure the location is
correctly set. The Firewall will then discover the correct IP address on the
interface when the ruleset is applied. For dial-up lines this is normaly
done automatically each time a new connection is established.
(See /etc/ppp/ip-up.local)
<p>
Note:	 If you specify address 0.0.0.0 and netmask 0.0.0.0, the address will not be converted, but kept as a specification of all possible addresses.
	<p>


<b>Example:</b>

ADSL line to internet:
<pre>
interface(
        ip=0.0.0.0
	location=EXT,ppp0
	type=interface
	name=FW-ADSL
)
</pre>
VPN on top of dialup ( adsl etc):
<pre>
interface(
        ip=0.0.0.0
	location=EXT,ipsec0
	type=interface
	name=FW-EXT-ipsec
)
		 
</pre>


ip-up.local
<pre>
#!bin/sh

/etc/rc.d/init.d/fwstart.sh restart
/etc/rc.d/init.d/cfw_vpn restart
</pre>
