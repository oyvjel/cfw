# This file holds shared secrets or RSA private keys for inter-Pluto
# authentication.  See ipsec_pluto(8) manpage, and HTML documentation.

# Shared secret (an arbitrary character string, which should be both long
# and hard to guess, enclosed in quotes) for a pair of negotiating hosts.
# Must be same on both; generate on one and copy to the other.
